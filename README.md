Urban Heat Index Prediction and Mitigation Tool üå°Ô∏è
Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict urban heat island effects and provide actionable mitigation strategies. It uses machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict land surface temperature based on various urban and environmental features. The app also includes Explainable AI (XAI) visualizations and heat mitigation recommendations based on user inputs.

Features
Temperature Prediction:

Predicts land surface temperature based on urban and environmental features.

Uses a pre-trained Random Forest Regressor model.

Explainable AI (XAI):

Displays feature importance to explain model predictions.

Heat Mitigation Recommendations:

Provides actionable suggestions to reduce urban heat island effects.

Recommendations are based on user inputs and predefined heat thresholds.

Interactive Interface:

User-friendly input fields for urban parameters.

Real-time predictions and visualizations.

Scalable and Customizable:

Easily adaptable to different cities and datasets.

Thresholds and recommendations can be customized.
